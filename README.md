# Yugioh-Database
This is a side project that parses through a yugioh database found here: https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php.

Day 1: Able to search through a portion of the database. However, parsing through the database proved to be difficult seeing that it is a php file and not json. 

Seeing that it proves to be difficult to access the .php file, I have decided to look for another database that is similar for Yu-gi-oh
